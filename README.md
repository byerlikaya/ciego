Visual Mystery Systems

The goal of this project is to turn any glass surface (display window, window, car window, etc.) into a screen.

The working principle of the project is to automatically play videos loaded onto the device at specified intervals.

Imagine this: You are in a shopping mall, and suddenly the storefront of the store in front of you turns into a giant screen, playing the brand's campaign videos or advertisements. Isn't it fascinating?

Or consider this: While you are browsing store windows (through sensors that detect you), suddenly the store's window turns into a screen, showing you campaigns related to the products you are looking at.

You can play the videos you want hourly or at intervals you determine.

Or if you are a store owner and want your store to stand out in the evenings, you can deliver your brand's ads or campaigns to your customers when you are not there. Isn't it an effective method, in your opinion?

Of course, there are many technical details in this project that I cannot share here, but I have tried to support it as visually as possible.

The project runs on Raspberry Pi and has been developed using Python.
